The [[msl_wheeltest_full.jpg][Mars Science Laboratory]] (scheduled for launch November 2011) prepares for an in-place turn

My personal favorite use of our collective tax dollars happens to have been doing its first full-scale drive test on Friday, and I got to see it first-hand and take some pictures.  Granted, I was behind a (very finger-smudged) pane of glass about sixty feet away, but it was still pretty awesome nevertheless.

The rover, which weighs more than [[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/missiondetails.cfm?mission=MER][Spirit and Opportunity]] put together, was on the floor doing drive tests for the first time.  The test involved driving forward and backward on the ESD-protective floor covering and turning its wheels first individually and then as a group.  They concluded testing just before executing an in-place turn, however, much to the dismay of the spectators.

In case you aren&#39;t up to speed on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory][Mars Science Laboratory]] [[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/missiondetails.cfm?mission=MSL][mission]], it is another in the same overall line as the MER rovers.  It has a very ambitious [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory#Landing_system][landing system]], as the same inflatable impact system from MER will not work on a rover as heavy as MSL.  The landing vehicle will slow initially with a typical heat-shield before ejecting a series of three parachutes to slow it down.  Once it is finished with these, a powered &#34;sky crane&#34; will hold itself aloft while lowering the MSL rover to the surface for a soft landing and then flying away (to an &#34;uncontrolled landing&#34; some unspecified distance from the rover).  I can&#39;t even explain what a lot of the instruments on the rover do, but I have been doing flight software testing of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory#MSL_Entry_Descent_and_Landing_Instrumentation_.28MEDLI.29][MEDLI]] and part of the telecommunications subsystem.

Hopefully I&#39;ve provided enough fun links to keep you occupied for awhile.  Lots of cool tech being used on the mission and lots of cool science to be done once it&#39;s there.  Cheers!
