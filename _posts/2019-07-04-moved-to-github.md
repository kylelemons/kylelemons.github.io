Every few years I decide that my current hosting solution isn't ideal and go looking for a new one.

This year, I've decided to reduce costs (because my website receives so little traffic)
by moving my static content over to GitHub Pages.

Feel free to check out the source if you want to see the content of my old blog's posts,
but realistically I probably won't spend the required amount of time to update them to Jekyll
beyond what I've done so far
(which was to dump them from the Ghost sqlite database and hackishly template that out to files).

If you're looking for my CS1372 resources, you can find them [here](/downloads/cs1372).

The most popular references are these:

* An [old proposal](/downloads/GoGenericsProposal.pdf) for how generics could look in Go.
* A [Guide](/downloads/PointersInC.pdf) to pointers in C
